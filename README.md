# Ghostery Private Browser

Current manifest is largely inspired by the one from [Librewolf community](https://gitlab.com/librewolf-community/browser/flatpak/).

To upgrade the manifest to any new release, please use the script available in the [Ghostery Private Browser Linux support](https://github.com/ghostery/ghostery-browser-linux-support) repository.

The current repository should be used to report any issue related to the packaging of the Ghostery Private Browser.
